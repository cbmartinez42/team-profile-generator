## Features
* Utilizes JavaScript and Node.js to provide a simple user interface
    * Inquirer module for command prompts
    * Jest module for tests
* Utilizes class constructors to unify object data for different role types

### Challenges
* Overall I've struggled with utilizing class constructors for Object Oriented Programming. My tutor was able to help clarify the usage of these and how they interact with the overall programming framework
* Creating tests was also a challenge. The instructions provided helped with knowing that elements to test, and I was able to get assistance from classmates in determining the proper way to test my class constructors
